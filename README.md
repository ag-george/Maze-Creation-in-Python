# Maze-Creation, Python
Create NxN Mazes using Python 

This is a Side-Project I came across while working on an Assignment for the Artificial Intelligence Class I took at ECE, NTUA in 2021.
It is an idea I came up with and it seems like a funny and interesting way to create an  𝑁×𝑁  maze using Python.
